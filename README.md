The goal of this repository is to understand a minimal implementation of a Nakamoto transactional blockchain by writing a few tests.

This repo was inspired by :

https://github.com/drewrice2/simple_blockchain
[Aunyks's tiny blockchain implementation in Python](https://gist.github.com/aunyks/47d157f8bc7d1829a729c2a6a919c173)
[Satoshi Nakamoto's blockchain whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)

### Implementation

#### Blocks!
A block is an object that contains, in this implementation, a series of
transactional data. All previous transactions are available in a ledger called
the blockchain. A blockchain is a sequence of blocks agreed upon by a network of
workers. Thus the integrity of the whole system can be verified by using a
mathematical function in which the answer is difficult to obtain but easy to
check. This mathematical check can be performed on each block all the way back
to the first block. The validity of the blocks is determined by using a Proof of
Work algorithm. More on that later.

#### Nodes
Upon startup, nodes check for peers and their respective blockchains. If no
peers are found, an initial block is created. A node can process a transaction,
mine, and return the blockchain upon request.

#### Consensus Algorithm
A blockchain is decided to be the master chain by evaluating lengths of other
nodes' blockchains. The longest chain is decided to be the master blockchain. I
plan to implement the consensus algorithm outlined in Nakamoto's paper which
seeks the longest chain with the greatest proof of work.

#### Mining
Mining from a node is a transactional relationship where the miner is rewarded
for completing a very simple, yet verifiable mathematical task. Similar to the
Proof of Work outlined in Nakamoto's whitepaper, this implementation requires a
hash be created with a specified number of leading zero bits. This hash is a
result of passing a string, made by concatenating a Block's previous hash and a
nonce (the constant the miner is solving for), through the SHA256 hashing
function. Once the nonce is solved for, the miner is rewarded and a new block is
generated.

### Use

Change `PORT` and `peer_nodes` in `node.py` to launch more nodes. Communication
of transactions between nodes has not been implemented yet.

To retrieve the existing blockchain from a node:
```bash
curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8060/blocks
```

To run the mining process and generate Blocks:
```bash
curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8060/mine
```

To send a transaction to the node:

(Linux/UNIX)
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{'to':'you',
  'from':'me','amount':10}" http://localhost:8060/transaction
```

(Windows)
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"to\":\"you\",
  \"from\":\"me\",\"amount\":10}" http://localhost:8060/transaction
```

### Future plans and other details

I plan to learn much more about the fundamentals of blockchain by way of
implementation. This repo began as a side project in a private repository. After
making some initial headway, I figured some people may be interested in Python
blockchains.

Constructive criticism and questions are welcomed! This implementation is far
from perfect; I will be refactoring and optimizing as time allows.

Aside from built-in Python packages, such as `json`, this implementation
requires:
- flask
- requests
- datetime

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
